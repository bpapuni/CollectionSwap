            <strong class="faq">I’ve made an account, but I can’t swap!? <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></strong>
            <p style="display: none">To begin swapping, first, create a collection from the options we have available. Then, go to your account page and add your mailing address. This part is important because it helps us send your collectibles to the correct spot when you swap them. Once these two steps have been completed visit the 'Find Swaps' page to request your first swap.</p>

            <p style="display: none">Absolutely! Swappers have the flexibility to swap any number of items in a single exchange as long as they're from the same collection and it's an even exchange (e.g. 2 for 2). </p>

            <p style="display: none">Our system scans all users' collections and attempts to match you with other users who have items that you need and require items that you have duplicates of. If no other users meet these conditions the system will will not return any matches.</p>

            <p style="display: none">If you haven't received your items within two weeks, the option to provide feedback will become available. You may consider leaving negative feedback as a cautionary measure to inform the community and aid others in their future swap decisions.</p>

            <strong class="faq">Do I have to give feedback after a swap? <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></strong>
            <p style="display: none">No you don't, however, providing feedback helps build trust in our community and allows other swappers to know about your experience. You do not need to leave any comments you can simply give the user a rating out of five.</p>

        <div class="column">
            <strong class="faq">How do I leave feedback for other users? <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></strong>
            <p style="display: none">The option to provide feedback will become available after you've ticked both the 'Sent' and 'Received' checkboxes in the Swap History table, confirming that you've sent out your items and received the items you've requested. Alternatively, you can provide feedback once two weeks has passed since the swap was confirmed. </p>

            <strong class="faq">Can I dispute feedback? <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></strong>
            <p style="display: none">
                Certainly! We understand that sometimes feedback can raise questions or concerns. If you believe there's an issue with a particular feedback, you can dispute it by sending an email to our <a href="mailto:collectionswapnz@gmail.com">CollectionSwapNz@gmail.com</a>. Please include the 'feedback id' of the specific feedback you'd like to dispute in your message.
                <br />
                <br />
                We want to assure you that we take your concerns seriously. However, please understand that while we do our best to address feedback disputes, our administrators have various responsibilities, and their primary focus may not always be on resolving disputes. Therefore, it might take some time for us to get back to you and thoroughly review your concern.
                <br />
                <br />
                Thank you for your patience and understanding as we work to provide the best possible experience for all our users. Your feedback helps us continually improve Swapper.

            <strong class="faq">I have items I no longer need. Can I give these items away? <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></strong>
            <p style="display: none">Of course! Open a collection from the 'Your Collections' page and you'll find a checkbox you can tick to mark that collection for charity. This displays a 'Charity' swap to other users containing ALL the items within your collection, so you should remove any items you do not wish to give away. </p>

            <strong class="faq">I would like to collect multiple sets of a particular collection, how can I manage that? <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></strong>
            <p style="display: none">Instead of creating one collection with all of your items in it, you can actually create multiple sets of a collection. This allows you to manage each collection independently. </p>
