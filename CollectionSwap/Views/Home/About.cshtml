            <p>Meet the fantastic minds behind Swapper! We are three students currently studying for our Bachelor of IT degrees at Whitireia and WelTec. This website is our Capstone project, which means it's like the grand finale of our studies! We've put our heads together to create a place where you can trade and share collectibles with fellow enthusiasts just like you. So, get ready to dive into our world of swapping fun!</p>
